# Typography

## Basics

### Families
Copa uses two type families for its texts across the UI, Gilroy and Suisse. These fonts have well-defined uses across the digital ecosystem and work together to provide the best readability possible while clearly identifying our UI with Copa’s brand.

#### Gilroy
Regular | Medium | **Bold**

For use in titles and large display text in general.

#### Suisse Int'l
Light | Regular | Medium | **Semibold**

For use in smaller text where readability is crucial. Also applies for long paragraphs.

### Typographic scale

All text styles are based on this typographic scale. The scale dictates **font sizes, line heights and character spacing**. The scale assumes a Base size of 16px and grows upward 6 values and downward 3 values. There’s a different scale for each breakpoint and values change accordingly (e.g. U6 in large is 76px, while in Xsmall is 36px).

Include class `text-{name}` to your element to use on of the following scales. [Go to story]('./?path=/story/system-foundations-typography--scale&globals=viewport:iphone14promax') to view the scales on the different viewports
